Using the default options file, determine the number of iterations to converge for each solver below and explain your results.

**(a)** Jacobi-preconditioned Richardson: `-ksp_type richardson -pc_type jacobi`

**(b)** Unpreconditioned conjugate gradient, 1 processor: `-ksp_type cg -pc_type none`

**(c)** Unpreconditioned conjugate gradient with $c = 0$. Explain your results.

**(d)** ICC-preconditioned conjugate gradient, 1 processor: `-ksp_type cg -pc_type icc`. Explain your results.

**(e)** Block Jacobi–preconditioned CG with 4 processors: `-ksp_type cg -pc_type bjacobi -pc_sub_type icc`

**(f)** MUMPS direct solver, 1 and 4 processors: `-ksp_type preonly -pc_type lu -pc_factor_solver_type mumps`

| (e)  | CG + bjacobi (icc)      | 4       | _____      |
| (f)  | MUMPS (direct)          | 1       | —          |
| (f)  | MUMPS (direct)          | 4       | —          |

### (a) Jacobi-preconditioned Richardson

$\kappa(A) \sim O(m^2)$, so convergence is slow; expect many iterations. Jacobi only scales, it does not fix conditioning.

### (b) Unpreconditioned CG, 1 processor

Iterations scale like $O(\sqrt{\kappa}) \sim O(m)$.

### (c) Unpreconditioned CG with $c = 0$

The matrix $A$ is unchanged; iteration count should match (b).

### (d) ICC-preconditioned CG, 1 processor

Strong preconditioner for SPD $A$; expect a large drop in iterations compared with (b).

### (e) Block Jacobi + ICC, 4 processors

Weaker than global ICC; more iterations than (d), fewer than (b). Good parallel scalability.

### (f) MUMPS direct (1 and 4 processors)

Direct solver, no iterations; compare run time and memory for 1 vs 4 processors.
